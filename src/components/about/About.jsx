                            <p>Hi my name is Ayeza. I am 22 years old. I have Bachelors degree in Software Engineering and I am doing my MPhill in Software Engineering </p>
                            <p>I started learning Web Development after my degree in 2022. It was easy for me to grasp that as I already learned C++ and Java basics.
                                I started from the very start HTML and CSS and worked my way up to JavaScript and then making simple projects but it still was not enough, I moved to advanced JS courses and started working on building my logic skills.
                                I did Leetcode and Codewars challenges now and then and it really helped me open my mind. I started uploading my projects on github and it really boosted my confidence after watching the green dots displaying how consistent
                                I have been in coding and I have not stopped since then.
                            </p>
                            <p>I still have lots to learn but I am consistent and I am willing to take challenges.</p>
